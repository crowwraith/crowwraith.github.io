                    currently im a software developer in training, and this website was the end project of the
                    second period of classes
                    , ( about 13 weeks total lessons at time of writing)
                    this is supposed to showcase my ability to make websites, though i currently have no intention of
                    going into this direction with my education. my preferance would more be towards cybersecurity and
                    problem solving.

                    pinkgoose was my starting project for website design for my first school periode. We where told to make a website based on a figma design,
                     this was also the first time i did anything with HTML, and in hindsight i could have done a lot different. but i still feel like its inportant to
                    show where we started

                    mastermind was the first java project i made, like pinkgoose this was done in the first periode of my schooling, and the first time i did anything with java
                    this project was also updated in the 2nd periode of classes (though i dont think thats showing on github atm.)

                    I recently chose to switch my career into IT, befor this I was a full time cook, mostly in
                    average
                    sized
                    restaurants with about 15 colleagues. I can work alone fairly well, but it does help to have
                    someone
                    around
                    to ask questions to.

                    Currently Im mostly playing games with friends all around the world, and i quite enjoy reading adventure, fantasy or sci-fi novels.
                    currently my favorite book probally is "sons of odin", by L.A. Hammer
                    In spring and summer Id occasionally go biking when the weather is nice and I don't feel
                    like sitting at home.
